# Max Refactor

## Description 

Overview
This README.md file provides an overview of the Accessibility Refactoring Challenge undertaken for Horiseon Marketing Agency. In this challenge I was tasked with enhancing an existing website to adhere to accessibility standards, to ensure that it is optimised for search engines and accessible to people with disabilities.

Motivation
My motivation was to learn how to refactor html and css so I can make websites accessible to individuals with disabilities to provide equal access, and also implement best practice for search engine optimisation. 

Project Scope
Working with html and css code provided as part of the project, the objective was to satisfy certain requirements for accessibility standards. These requirements included the use of semantic HTML components, the maintenance of a logical structure apart from styling, the inclusion of accessible alt attributes for pictures and icons, the ordering of heading attributes, and the creation of a succinct and informative title element.


Key Features:
- Implementation of semantic HTML elements throughout the source code.
- Logical structuring of HTML elements, ensuring independence from styling and positioning.
- Inclusion of accessible alt attributes for images and icons, enhancing usability for visually impaired users.
- Organization of heading attributes in sequential order, improving content readability and navigation.
- Crafting a concise and descriptive title element, enhancing the website's context and relevance.

Technologies Used 
-Visual Studio Code
-GitBash
-HTML
-CSS

Future Enhancements
While the current challenge focused on meeting specific accessibility criteria, there are several potential areas for 


Future improvement
Interactive Elements - Enhance interactive elements like forms and buttons for keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
Content Expansion - Enrich the website content, making it more informative and engaging for all users.
Visual Design - Improve the visual design to ensure a pleasant user experience for all visitors, regardless of abilities.
Responsive Design - Create a visual experience that adapts to different screen sizes to enhance user experience
